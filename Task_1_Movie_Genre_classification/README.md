# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification - CODSOFT Internship

This repository contains my solution for **Task 1** of the **Machine Learning Internship at CodSoft**.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Create a machine learning model that can predict the **genre of a movie** based on its **plot summary** or textual description.

## 🧠 Approach

1. Preprocessing movie plot descriptions
2. Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**
3. Classification using **Logistic Regression**
4. Evaluation using **accuracy**, **classification report**, and **confusion matrix**
5. Handling imbalanced genres in real-world datasets

## 🔧 Tech Stack

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
TF-IDF Vectorizer

## 📊 Model Results

* High accuracy on dominant genres like `Drama`, `Comedy`, and `Short`
* Confusion Matrix reveals misclassification in overlapping genres
* Plan to improve using multi-label classification or BERT embeddings
